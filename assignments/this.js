/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global/Window Binding
    When in the global scope the value of "this" will be the window/console object

* 2. Implicit Binding
    When a method on an object is called the value of "this" will be bound to the object on which the method is being called on.

* 3. New Binding
    When a new object is being created using a constructor "this"  will be bound to the new instance of the object being created.

* 4. Explicit Binding
    When call or apply methods are used "this" will be bound to what ever object we specify
*   
* write out a code example of each explanation above
